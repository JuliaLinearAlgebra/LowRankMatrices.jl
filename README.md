This package is an offshoot of `LowRankApprox.jl`, and provides the `LowRankMatrix` type that is used in that package. It should be a lightweight dependency if you only need to use a `LowRankMatrix` without the functionality provided by `LowRankApprox.jl`.

Currently, the package only defines and exports `LowRankMatrix`, although this might change in the future.
