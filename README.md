# LowRankMatrices

[![CI](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/LowRankMatrices.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/LowRankMatrices.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

This package is an offshoot of `LowRankApprox.jl`, and provides the `LowRankMatrix` type that is used in that package. It should be a lightweight dependency if you only need to use a `LowRankMatrix` without the functionality provided by `LowRankApprox.jl`.
