# LowRankMatrices

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jishnub/LowRankMatrices.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jishnub/LowRankMatrices.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This package is an offshoot of `LowRankApprox.jl`, and provides the `LowRankMatrix` type that is used in that package. It should be a lightweight dependency if you only need to use a `LowRankMatrix` without the functionality provided by `LowRankApprox.jl`.
